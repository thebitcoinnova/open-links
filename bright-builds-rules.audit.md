# Bright Builds Rules Audit Trail

<!-- bright-builds-rules-managed-file: bright-builds-rules.audit.md -->

This file records that this repository is using the Bright Builds Rules and shows where the managed adoption files came from.

This audit trail is managed upstream by `bright-builds-rules`. If the managed audit format or content needs a fix, open an upstream PR or issue instead of editing the downstream copy directly.

## Why this exists

- It provides a visible paper trail for install, update, and uninstall operations.
- The installer manages a bounded block inside `AGENTS.md`, a bounded README badge block when applicable, and marked whole-file managed surfaces such as the sidecar, audit trail, contribution guide, PR template, and optional auto-update files.
- `standards-overrides.md` remains repo-local and is preserved during update and uninstall.
- It helps humans and tools debug which standards revision a repository is pinned to.
