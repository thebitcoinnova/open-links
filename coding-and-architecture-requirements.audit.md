## Why this exists

- It provides a visible paper trail for install, update, and uninstall operations.
- The installer manages a bounded block inside `AGENTS.md`, a bounded README badge block when applicable, and marked whole-file managed surfaces such as the sidecar, audit trail, contribution guide, PR template, and optional auto-update files.
- `standards-overrides.md` remains repo-local and is preserved during update and uninstall.
- It helps humans and tools debug which standards revision a repository is pinned to.
