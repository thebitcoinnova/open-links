- [ ] Any repo-specific exception has been recorded in `standards-overrides.md`.

## Verification

- [ ] Relevant repo-native verification ran and passed when applicable
- [ ] Any CI-only or hook-owned verification exception is documented
- [ ] Changed paths were validated manually when appropriate

## Risks

Document any residual risk, rollout concern, or follow-up work.
